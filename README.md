# Fastners detection with Support Vector Machine

In this repostory I am going to create a detection system using traditional machine learning system to detect fastners and track them.

## Steps:
1. Image collection
2. Feature Extractions
3. Train SVM
4. Implement the trained model
5. Track fastners at speed of conveyor
6. Count system
